Working with twitter data using R.

The observations are the set of tweets by then US president to-be in
2016 election year. The tweets were sent from different electric
devices, and the some devices show clear tendency at what time of a
day the tweets were sent. We will investigate who is using which
device, and if there are tendency of sentiment that may highlight the
sender's state of mind.

This analysis is part of practice performed during the online lecture
in Harvard X for Data Science in 2020.
